We're just looking at September 2023 for right now. we want to know at a specific instance in time, how many riders there are? Now obviously the amount of people riding will be different for every day, so I think we may be looking for an average only.

(Still need to add a map into the plot. Will do so soon.)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)

rm(list = ls())

bikes <- read_csv("data_raw/202309-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% clean_names()

ggplot(data = bikes, mapping = aes(x = start_lng, y = start_lat)) +geom_point()
```
